# Decoding Startup Success: An Analytical Approach

## Overview
This repository hosts a Jupyter Notebook that explores factors influencing startup success and failure. The analysis is divided into three main sections: data visualization, machine learning model application, and historical analysis of economic impacts.

## Notebook Content
- **Data Visualization**: Visual interpretations of data to identify hidden patterns and insights.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Development and tuning of models to predict startup outcomes.
- **Historical Analysis**: Examination of how historical economic trends influence startup success.

## Data
The data used in this project includes various attributes of startups. However, the dataset is not included in this repository due to privacy concerns.

## Model.ipynb
The notebook, `Model.ipynb`, guides through the analysis process:
1. **Data Visualization**: Utilizes Google Colabâ€™s suggested charts, custom plots and word clouds to  visualize data effectively.
2. **Data Imputation**: Handles missing values with appropriate imputation techniques specific to the data type and context.
3. **Machine Learning Models**: Implements predictive models, including a detailed application of RFE with Gradient Boosting to determine the likelihood of startup success.

## Conclusion
This project investigates the factors that lead to the success or failure of startups using advanced data visualization and machine learning techniques. By examining historical data, the project identifies key patterns and predictors of success, providing actionable insights for entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers. The findings highlight the importance of data-driven decision-making in the dynamic startup ecosystem, offering a foundation for strategies to enhance startup viability and growth.
